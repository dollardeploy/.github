## Hi there 👋

We are building the deployment platform, so startups, developers, indie-makers and open-source software users can easily deploy software to the servers they own.

[Visit the platform](https://dollardeploy.com/?utm_source=github)

[See & contribute to the open-source templates](https://github.com/dollardeploy/templates)

[Run your own app with our boilerplates - NextJs, Go, Rust, Python, Java or PHP natively running on your server](https://github.com/orgs/dollardeploy/repositories)

[Documentation](https://docs.dollardeploy.com)
